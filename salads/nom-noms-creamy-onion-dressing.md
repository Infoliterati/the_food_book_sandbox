# Nom Nom's Creamy Onion Dressing

I make a batch of this dressing and freeze it in silicone muffin cups and defrost a portion when I need it!

**Creamy Onion Dressing**

* 6 unpeeled garlic cloves
* 3 medium, unpeeled yellow onions \(about 1 1/2 pounds\)
* 1 1/4 cups extra-virgin olive oil or avocado oil, divided
* 1/4 cup lemon juice
* 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
* 1 tablespoon kosher salt
* Freshly ground black pepper



1. Place the garlic and onions in a baking dish and drizzle 1/4 cup of the olive oil on top. Roast for 1 hour or until tender and charred. Cool to room temperature.
2. Once cooled, peel the onions and garlic. Trim the root ends off the onions and roughly chop them into uniform pieces.
3. In a blender, puree the onions, garlic, lemon juice and vinegar until smooth.
4. With the blender running, slowly add 1 cup of olive oil until well incorporated.
5. Season with salt and pepper.
