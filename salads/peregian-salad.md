# Peregian Salad

**Ingredients - not really sure of the proportions but guessing here, it would probably be a great meal/lunch to make with leftovers**

1 chorizo sausage, sliced and sauteed

 50 grams feta

chicken \(left over will do\)

sweet potato \(cubed and roasted\)

2 cups salad mix

1/2 Lebanese cucumber, sliced

8 cherry tomatoes, halved

**Method**

wash your veggies and throw everything together with your favorite salad dressing  \(I personally like Michelle Tam's creamy onion and garlic dressing myself!\)
